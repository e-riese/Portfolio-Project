        <h3 id="p2">My greatest lesson with the operations assignment was...</h3>
        <p> 
            ...learning how to keep organized when following up on cases. For difficult cases I did have the tendency to keep 
            leaving them for tomorrow. But if you do that every day, you end up leaving it for weeks and scrambling to get it done. 
            <strong>It’s easy to procrastinate the tough stuff,</strong> but in the end <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">just facing it head on by doing the 
            next right step to get it done is always the way to go</span></strong>. It feels like it takes a longer time to do, but in the end, 
            you’ll spend less time on it overall and get it done faster. And that’s true for the Commercial Service Advisor 
            requests as well as all difficult tasks in life.


        </p>
        <h3>What surprised me the most was...</h3>
        <p>
            ...how diverse the commercial clients of RBC are and learning about the inner workings of the bank. 
            Banks are so ingrained in day-to-day life that I forget that <strong>they are also businesses in of themselves, </strong>
            not public institutions. Working with commercial clients every day you realize the real reason a bank is there to 
            offer financial products and services to generate a profit, and our work was directly making that happen. 
            <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">My perception of what a bank is shifted</strong></span> from an everyday institution in society to more of <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">the actual business model.</span></strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            It was also surprising to see the breadth and depth of the businesses across Canada working with RBC. I would get 
            requests from all sorts of industries, like entertainment companies, retail, townships, real estate developers, 
            transport, plumbers, electricians, dentistry, law firms and even bubble tea shops. Getting a <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">peek inside the backbone 
            of the Canadian economy was eye opening</span></strong> to what’s really happening in Canada, and <strong>what is really meant when we 
            talk about the Canadian economy.</strong>

        <h3 id="p3">My favourite memory was...</h3>
        <p>
            ...having lunch with my team every day. Even though we talked on Webex before going in office, we didn’t really 
            get to <strong>build those connections</strong> until we were able to talk face-to-face. Once we started to get more comfortable 
            with each other, it really became something to look forward to when coming in office. <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">They became the people 
            who understood what I was going through at work the most</strong></span> since we were all in the same boat and going through the 
            same things. <strong>It felt good to have support and people to discuss the experience of the internship with.</strong>
        </p>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px">I honestly feel that I’ve made genuine connections and friends through this rotation, 
            and I hope that we will get the chance to meet up again soon! </span></strong>
