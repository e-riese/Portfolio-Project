            <h3 id="p2">When I graduated from university, the first thing I felt was...</h3>
            <p> ...the relief that the stress of exams would finally be over! 
                I was so happy that I could finally take a proper break and eventually start my journey in the working world. It took me a 
                long time to figure out what I wanted to do in university, so finally <strong>graduating from a program that truly gave 
                me a sense of purpose was such an incredible feeling</strong>. It was truly gratifying that all the years of hard work had paid off.<br><br>
                I started off studying International Development at the University of Waterloo, only to realize that it wasn’t really the 
                program for me. We spent a lot of time discussing the global issues that I was interested in without actually approaching them in a very 
                realistic or pragmatic way. I decided to transfer to the <span style="font-size: 25px"></span><strong>University of Toronto to study Economics, Maths and Statistics so that I could learn 
                the skills required to actually understand these global issues in an extensive way.</strong> The journey of my tertiary education was a long one, 
                but definitely one I am proud of since I’m able to understand these multifaceted issues in a comprehensive way.

        <div class="text-container">
            <h3>What surprised me the most about graduating was...</h3>
            <p>
                ...no longer having structure to my daily routine, as well as “the bigger picture” in a sense.  
                Real life isn’t like school. There are no “next levels” to reach and there are no pre-set goals you have to 
                accomplish. No one’s going to force you to do anything really, and it’s up to you to make things happen for yourself. <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">It felt like 
                staring into the ocean. It was overwhelming and uncertain, but at the same time there were a myriad of opportunities on the horizon.</span></strong> You can 
                really take your life wherever you want to if you’re determined enough. That means there isn’t anyone else to blame, and in the end you need 
                to look in the mirror and take responsibility for what’s in front of you.

            <h3 id="p3">During my job search I honestly felt...</h3>
            <p>
                ...a bit confused. I wasn’t sure what people wanted to hear or even how the hiring process worked. 
                A lot of the questions are so standardized and in many way so are the answers, but it took me a while to pick up on that. 
                There’s lots of subtle etiquettes that no one really teaches you and people don’t really like to talk about. It was also 
                hard to find the realistic balance between what I wanted out of a job, and what I could realistically get just starting out. 
                <strong>No job is perfect, nothing ever is, but it took me a while to 
                understand that it’s going to take a while to get to exactly where I want to be.</strong> I used to think that this was a bad 
                thing, but after reflecting I look at it in a positive light. A career is 
                a journey and it's rare to land the perfect job and position right off the bat. <strong>It’s not a big deal when things 
                take a bit longer than you expect them to, <span style="font-size: 25px">especially if in the long run you’re headed in the right direction.</span></strong>

            <h3>My biggest shock when looking for a job was...</h3>
            <p>
                ...<strong><span style="font-size: 25px">“you need experience for a job, and you need a job for experience”.</span></strong> 
                I had worked quite a number of jobs during my time at university and volunteered for causes I saw value in, but it didn’t really add up to the coherent
                and linear career path experience that recruiters were looking for. If you don’t have a large network to ask around in, you’re sort of stuck just applying 
                through online job posting websites which aren’t always reliable or informative.

            <h3 id="p4">When I was accepted into the Career Launch Program, I was...</h3>
            <p>
                ...honestly ecstatic. I’m forever grateful to my previous job for taking me 
                in and training me when I had very little work experience. However, when looking for a job <strong>the one thing I wanted was the chance to 
                learn and grow more than anything.</strong> After a few months there, it didn’t seem that there was much more to learn more about my role or more responsibility 
                I could take on within the immediate team. I felt stuck after a few months there. I would tell myself every day that it wouldn’t be forever, 
                and when I finally got that call saying I was in the program, it really felt like my day had come. Not only did I get into a work 
                program that would allow me to learn and grow, it was also very specific to what I studied in university. I learned mostly about economics and banking during my time 
                at university, as well as non-profits and their work. The diversity of the program's three rotations seemed to fit my interests perfectly.
                <br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 25px">I’m looking forward to being able to complement what I’m passionate about with relevant work experience and to fully engage with everything that the program has to offer.</span></strong>
