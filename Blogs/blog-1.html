        <h3 id="p2">When I graduated from university, the first thing I felt was...</h3>
        <p> ...the relief that the stress of exams would finally be over! 
            I was so happy that I could finally take a proper break and eventually start my journey in the working world. It took me a 
            long time to figure out what I wanted to do in university so finally <strong>graduating in something that I really enjoyed, valued 
            and worked hard for was such an incredible feeling</strong>. It was so great to know that all the years of hard work had paid off.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            I started off studying International Development at the University of Waterloo, only to realize that it wasn’t really the 
            program for me. <i><strong>We spent a lot of time discussing the issues I was interested in without actually approaching them in a very 
            realistic way.</strong></i> I decided to transfer to the University of Toronto to study Economics, Maths and Statistics so that I could learn 
            the skills required to actually understand these global issues on a deeper level. The journey of my tertiary education was a long one, 
            but definitely not one I regret as I now have experience from understanding what I’m interested in a multifaceted way.
        </p>
        <h3>What surprised me the most about graduating was...</h3>
        <p>
            ...having no more structure to not only my daily routine, but also “the bigger picture” 
            in a sense. Real life isn’t like school. <strong><span style="font-size: 25px"> aren’t really “next levels” to reach and there aren’t these pre-set goals you have to 
            accomplish. No one’s going to force you to do anything really, and it’s up to you to make things happen for yourself.</span></strong> It felt like 
            staring into the ocean. You can really take your life wherever you want to if you’re determined enough. That means there isn’t anyone 
            else to blame, and in the end you need to look in the mirror and take responsibility. It was scary because without the microstructure 
            of a daily routine and bigger picture goals you can really end up wasting a lot of time!

        <h3 id="p3">During my job search I honestly felt...</h3>
        <p>
            ...a bit confused. I wasn’t sure what people wanted to hear or even how the hiring process worked. 
            A lot of the questions are so standardized and in many way so are the answers, but only in hindsight I now realize that. There’s a lot 
            of subtle etiquette that no one really teaches you either which I had to slowly pick up. It was hard to find the realistic balance 
            between what I wanted out of a job, and what I could really get. <strong>No job is perfect, nothing ever is, but it took me a while to 
            understand that it’s going to take a while to get to exactly where I want to be.</strong> I used to think that this was a bad thing, but 
            now I look at it with in a positive light. <span style="font-size: 25px"><strong>A career should be more of a journey rather than landing the perfect job and position 
            right off the bat.</strong></span>
        </p>
        <h3>My biggest shock when looking for a job was...</h3>
        <p>
            ...the classic Catch-22 of <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">“you need experience for a job and you need a job for experience”.</span></strong> 
            I had worked quite a number of jobs during my time at university and volunteered, but it didn’t really add up to career path experience 
            that people were looking for. It was also difficult just to find job postings. If you don’t have a large network to ask around in, 
            you’re sort of stuck just applying through online job posting websites.
        </p>

        <h3 id="p4">When I was accepted into the Career Launch Program, I was...</h3>
        <p>
            ...honestly ecstatic. I’m forever grateful to my previous job for taking me 
            in and training me when I had very little work experience. However, when looking for a job <span style="font-size: 25px"><strong>the one thing I wanted was the chance to 
            learn and grow more than anything.</strong></span> After a few months there, people weren’t really keen on helping me to learn more about the business 
            or let me take on more responsibility. I felt very stuck for a long time. I would tell myself every day that it wouldn’t be forever, 
            and when I finally got that call saying I was in the program, <strong> it really felt like my day had come.</strong> Not only did I get into a work 
            experience position that would allow me to learn and grow, it was also very specific to what I studied in university. I learned a 
            lot about economics and banking during my time at university, as well as NGOs and their work. <strong>The diversity of the program through 
            its three rotations seemed to fit my interests perfectly.</strong> I’m still very excited to be able to complement what I’m passionate about 
            with real work experience.
        </p>
            <p><i><b>
            A funny side note:</b> The job advertisement stated that you had to be no older than 24 when the program started on March 15th, and my 
            birthday is March 16th 1998, if you can do that math. It honestly still seems like fate when I think about it. I’m guessing I’m the 
            oldest in the program? </i>
