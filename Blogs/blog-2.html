        <h3 id="p2">Getting ready to work in a hybrid format I feel...</h3>
        <p> I’m excited for the change to hybrid work! As much as I like the comfort of home, I feel like I need the face-to-face time with my 
            colleagues to really connect and get to know them properly. For me, <strong>is the perfect solution to get a balance between the pros and 
            cons of work-from-home and working in-office.</strong>  It’s been really great so far being able to get to know everyone better and see their faces!
        </p>
        <h3>Key takeaways from the RBC Personal Effectiveness Series are...
        </h3>
        <p>
            When I first heard the term ‘Radical Candor’ I was highly skeptical, but after the session I would really like to get the book and read it 
            for myself. The in-depth discussion on what it means to <span style="font-size: 25px"><strong>find the balance between being authentic yet remaining sensitive to other people's feelings</span></strong> was 
            deeply insightful. These things seem trivial at a glance, yet they are absolutely pertinent to forming good relationships not only with our 
            coworkers but in general. The point on how it’s a <strong>moral obligation to be candid to those you care for</strong> really changed my perspective. Usually, 
            I would let people be the way they are without wanting to intervene or get involved as a way to respect their privacy and space. However now I 
            see the value of speaking out and the ways you can do it respectfully and would like to try it more in my day-to-day life.

        <h3 id="p3">After the operations training, I felt...</h3>
        <p>
            I felt much more informed after completing the training! I majored in economics at university where I did many courses on banking and finance, 
            but <span style="font-size: 25px"><strong>it doesn’t prepare you for all the realities </span></strong> of what goes on behind the scenes. It’s been eye opening to compare the textbook learning to the 
            realities of real-world banking as well as being a part of it.
        </p>
        <h3>The support I received was...</h3>
        <p>
            I have received so much support from RBC during my entire time with the company I am really blown away by the overall <span style="font-size: 25px"><strong>uplifting and positive 
            company culture</strong></span>. I worked at a few companies before joining the Career Launch Program and from my experience it is rare to see such <strong>a positive 
            work environment that is truly committed to fostering growth of its employees</strong>.  I'm trying my best to pay it forward if there’s any way I can 
            help out others around the team also!
        </p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 25px">Looking forward to the rest of the Career Launch Program! </p></strong></span>
