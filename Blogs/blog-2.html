            <p>I’m excited for the change to hybrid work! As much as I like the comfort of home, I feel like I need the 
                <strong>face-to-face time with my colleagues to really connect and get to know them.</strong> For me, it’s the perfect solution 
                to get a balance between the pros and cons of work-from-home and working in-office. It’s been really great so far 
                being able to get to know everyone better and see their faces!

            <h3>Key takeaways from the RBC Personal Effectiveness Series are...
            </h3>
            <p>
                When I first heard the term ‘Radical Candor’ I was highly skeptical, but after the session I would really like to get the book and read it 
                for myself. The in-depth discussions we were having on what it means to find<strong> the balance between being authentic yet remaining sensitive 
                to other people</strong> was insightful. These things seem trivial at a glance, yet they are absolutely pertinent to forming good relationships not 
                only with coworkers but in our personal relationships too. The point on how it’s a <strong>moral obligation to be candid to those you care for </strong>has 
                really changed my perspective. Usually, I would let people be the way they are without wanting to intervene or get involved as a way to respect 
                their privacy and space. However now I see the value of speaking out and the ways you can do it respectfully and would like to try it more 
                in my day-to-day life.

            <p>
                I felt much more informed after completing the training. I majored in economics at university where I did many 
                courses on banking and finance, but it doesn’t prepare you for all the realities of what goes on behind the scenes. 
                It’s been eye opening to compare the textbook learning to the realities of all the small mechanisms of real-world 
                banking.

            <h3>The support I received was...</h3>
            <p>
                I received so much support from RBC during my entire time with the company I am really blown away by the overall 
                uplifting and positive company culture. I worked at a few companies before joining the Career Launch Program and 
                from my experience it is rare to see such a positive work environment that is truly committed to fostering growth 
                of its employees. I'm trying my best to pay it forward if there’s any way I can help out others around the team 
                when I can.
