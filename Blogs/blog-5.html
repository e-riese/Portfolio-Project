                The Next Great Social Innovator (NGSI) Challenge is the capstone learning event of the RBC Career Launch Program.
                This unique challenge was an opportunity to apply the skills learned from the internship to create an innovative solution.

                <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">...the Institutional Client and Credit Management Transaction team in Capital Markets.</span> I took over some of 
                the daily credit management tasks of the analyst and associates </strong> 
                while they were looking for a new permanent hire. I also took on some of the projects outside of the team's 
                day to day work which I will be working on for the next year during my contract extension.

            <p>
                <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">...develop and practice many skills: leadership, communication, creative thinking, public speaking, 
                presentations making, learning new software, UX/UI design, and time management</span></strong>  - to just name a few. 
                Our team worked really hard and saw great results because of it. It was a close debate among the judges 
                with an almost even 50/50 split on who they thought should be the winner, but in the end we came a very 
                close second. I was sad we didn’t end up coming first after putting so much work into it, but we made a 
                great idea, had a great presentation to back it up and tried our best so I don’t think of it as a loss.

            <p>
                ..Opportunity! I felt that this whole program has been a great experience to grow and learn. I had 
                always flourished at school, but breaking out into the working world was a whole different challenge, 
                especially being new to Canada. This program really gave me the mentorship and opportunity I needed 
                to make a start at a real career. I'll always look back on this experience and be grateful that it
                 came when it did.<strong><span style="font-size: 25px"> I’m also grateful for the doors it's opened for me, as well as the skills I have 
                 learned to be able to open more doors for myself and others in the future. </span></strong>

            <h3>What surprised me the most was... </h3>
            <p>
                <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">...how much I learned throughout the program and how much I've transformed since the beginning.</strong></span>
                It's only been a year, but so much has changed in my life because of this program. I couldn't 
                have imagined I would be where I am today if I hadn't gone through it. There were some truly 
                challenging moments, but I’ve come through the other side with more experience and wisdom because of it.

            <h3>I realized... </h3>
            <p>
                ..that I have a lot to offer! It's easy to let imposter syndrome kick in and make 
                you feel underqualified, but successfully completing all the diverse rotations has 
                really boosted my confidence. In each one I developed good standing relationships with 
                my managers and the teams I was working on. <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">People appreciated my work, my ideas and 
                what I had to offer.</span></strong> I now have a much better understanding of how to succeed in the 
                working world by being a proactive colleague rather than a more rote employee.
