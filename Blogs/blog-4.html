        <h3 id="p2">My role at the organization</h3>
            <p> 

                I worked with <a href="https://teachforcanada.ca/en/" target="_blank" >Teach for Canada - Gakinaamaage</a> for 3 months with their Growth and Partnerships team. I worked with 
                the team to develop a broad reach business strategy to engage major donors in the United States. This entailed 
                <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">developing a high touch fundraising program strategy in support of indigenous education centered around 
                personalized corporate and foundation engagement in the United States.</span></strong> The work mainly involved conducting grant 
                research and composing grant proposal drafts aimed towards well aligned potential donors.

            <h3>At the charity, I was surprised by...</h3>
            <p>
                …how casual the atmosphere was! After working with the commercial service advisor team for 6 months where we 
                were meeting strict end of day deadlines every day, it was such a contrast to experience a team that had a more 
                long-term goals and visions that they were working towards. The Growth and Partnership team was working hard
                 every day, but it felt like the daily <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">work was more focused towards the overarching long-term projects of the 
                 organization</span></strong> rather than pushing to meet day to day objectives. It felt like a complete 180 to the pace of the 
                 work in rotation one. 
                 The organization was also much smaller, so people were closer to one another and more familiar which fostered an 
                 exceptionally warm and welcoming work environment.

        <h3 id="p3">What I enjoyed most about working at the charity was...</h3>
        <p>
            …being able to make the work my own. I felt like in rotation one the work was quite fixed. We needed to deliver 
            standardized responses to maintain an assured level of quality for RBC customers. There was a quality component 
            to the work, but in many ways to showcase your efforts and talents it became much more about quantity which made 
            it difficult to feel a sense of ownership towards the work. With this rotation, the project was much more open, 
            and I could do as much as I felt appropriate to a quality that demonstrated a more holistic range of my knowledge 
            and capabilities. It was easier to <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">showcase my work ethic, my 
            problem-solving skills and my creative thinking which are all what I consider the best of what I have to offer in work environments and team settings.</span></strong>

        <!-- Fourth Paragraph in Blog -->
        <div class="text-container">
            <h3 id="p4">My most important realization at the charity was...</h3>
            <p>
                …how much I didn't know about Indigenous issues in Canada. After coming to Canada in 2016 I learned a bit 
                about Indigenous issues here, however it felt like a one-dimensional tale of tragedy. The story told to me 
                didn't encompass the <span style="font-size: 20px"><strong>nuances of the realities of contemporary Indigenous life in Canada and failed to 
                celebrate the triumphs uniqueness of First Nations while still acknowledging the traumatic history.</strong></span> 
                Teach For Canada Gakiaamaage is mostly led by Anishinaabe people, and often part of the team meetings 
                would <strong>incorporate First Nation culture, ideas, and practices to foster equitable collaboration.</strong> I could 
                see in my short time with the charity that leading the organization in this manner overall enriched the 
                team's experience and integrity towards their work. I was inspired to learn more about First Nations culture 
                after this work experience and I really hope that they will get to continue to do the work they do for as 
                long as possible.
