        <h3 id="p2">Describe your role at the charity:</h3>
        <p> 

            <strong>I worked with <a href="https://teachforcanada.ca/en/" target="_blank" >Teach for Canada - Gakinaamaage</a> for 3 months with their Growth and Partnerships team.</strong> I worked with 
            the team to develop a broad reach business strategy to engage major donors in the United States. This entailed 
            <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">developing a high touch fundraising program strategy in support of indigenous education centered around 
            personalized corporate and foundation engagement in the United States.</span></strong> The work mainly involved conducting grant 
            research and composing grant proposal drafts aimed towards well aligned potential donors.

        </p>

        <h3>At the charity, I was surprised by...</h3>
        <p>

            ...how casual the atmosphere was! After working with the commercial service advisor team for 6 months where 
            we were meeting end of day deadlines every day, it was such a contrast to experience a team that had more 
            long-term deadlines. The Growth and Partnership team was working very hard every day, but it felt like <strong>the 
            daily work was more focused towards the overarching long-term objectives of the organization</strong> rather than 
            pushing to meet day to day objectives. Reflecting on it, this is probably because the nature of the work 
            was very different. It felt like a complete 180 to the pace of the work in rotation one! The organization was 
            also much smaller, so people were closer to one another and more familiar which <strong><span style="font-size: 25px">fostered an exceptionally warm 
            and welcoming work environment.</span></strong> 
        </p>

        <h3 id="p3">What I enjoyed most about working at the charity was...</h3>
        <p>
            
            ...being able to make the work my own. I felt like in rotation one the work was quite fixed. We needed to 
            deliver standardized responses to maintain an assured level of quality for RBC customers. There was a quality 
            component to the work, but in many ways to showcase your efforts and talents it became much more about quantity. 
            With this rotation, the project was much more open, and I could do as much as I felt appropriate to a quality 
            that <strong>demonstrated a more holistic range of my knowledge and capabilities. It was easier to <span style="font-size: 25px">showcase my work ethic,
             my problem-solving skills and my creative thinking </span>which are all the best of what I have to offer in work 
             environments and team settings.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3 id="p4">My most important realization at the charity was...</h3>
        <p>...how much I didn't know about Indigenous issues in Canada. After coming to Canada in 2016 I learned a 
            bit about Indigenous issues here, however it felt like a one-dimensional tale of tragedy. <strong>The story 
            told to me didn't encompass the nuances of the realities of contemporary Indigenous life in Canada and 
            failed to celebrate the triumphs uniqueness of First Nations</strong> while still acknowledging the traumatic 
            history. Teach For Canada Gakiaamaage is led by an Anishinaabe person, and often part of the team meetings 
            would incorporate First Nation culture, ideas, and practices. I could see in my short time with the 
            charity that leading the organization in this manner overall <span style="font-size: 20px"><strong>enriched the team's experience and integrity 
            towards their work. I was inspired to learn more about First Nations culture</strong></span> after this work experience 
            and I really hope that they will get to continue to do the work they do for as long as possible.
